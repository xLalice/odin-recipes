    <h2>A sweet snack perfect for any time of the day: morning, noon, or night</h2>
    <p>I especially love ginataang mais with malagkit, or sticky rice, which makes this dish even more filling and flavorful. This Ginataang Mais at Malagkit is something you can enjoy by yourself or in the company of your loved ones. Depending on where you are from in the country, it can take up many different names, from lugaw na mais or lelot mais.
         Ginataang Mais at Malagkit is quick and easy to make, only taking about 30 minutes of overall cook and prep time.</p>
